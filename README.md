# SpaceY
Data Analysis Project for the Applied Data Science Capstone Course in IBM's Data Science Certificate

## Collecting the Data
This section of the project consisted of collecting and wrangling data from a few data soruces including SpaceX's API and Wikipedia. Notebooks and files associated with this phase of the project include the following:
- SpaceX Data Collection API Lab (jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb)
- SpaceX Launch, Flight, and Landing Dataset (dataset_part_1.csv)
- Data Collection Web Scraping Lab (jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb)
- Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Launch Records from Wikipedia (spacex_web_scraped.csv)

## Data Wrangling
In this section we examined data collected from the SpaceX api, performed some initial exploratory data analysis, and began to clean up values to make them more model friendly for future sections of this project. Notebooks and files associated with this phase of the project include the following:
- Data Wrangling Lab (labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling.ipynb)
- Wrangled and Cleand SpaceX Launch, Flight, and Landing Dataset (dataset_part_2.csv)

## Exploratory Data Analysis Using SQL
In this section we performed exploratory data analysis on the SpaceX dataset using SQL. Notebooks and files associated with this phase of the project include the following:
- Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL Lab (jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb)
- SpaceX Dataset for SQL Analysis (Spacex.csv)
- Exploratory Data Analysis with Visualization Lab (jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz.ipynb)
- SpaceX Dataset After Data Viz Lab (dataset_part_3.csv)

## Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard
In this section we used Folium to create interactive visuals with data from the landing sites, and built an interactive dashboard using plotly dash. Notebooks and files associated with this phase of the project include the following:
- Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium Lab (lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb)
- Interactive Dashboard with Plotly Dash Lab (spacex_dash_app.py)

## Predictive Analysis (Classification)
In this section we used machine learning to determine the best model to predict landing outcomes. Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and K Nearest Neighbor models were tested for performance:
